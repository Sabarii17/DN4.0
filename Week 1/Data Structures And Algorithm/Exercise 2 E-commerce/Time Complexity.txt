Time Complexity Comparison:


Linear Search:

Best Case: O(1) — Element is at the first position.

Average Case: O(n) — Element is in the middle.

Worst Case: O(n) — Element is at the end or not present.

Sorted data required: No

Binary Search:

Best Case: O(1) — Element is in the middle of the list.

Average Case: O(log n) — List is divided in half each step.

Worst Case: O(log n) — Element is not present after several halvings.

Sorted data required: Yes


Suitability for E-Commerce Platform:

Binary Search is more suitable when:

The product list is large.

The list can be sorted by product name or ID.

High-speed search performance is required.


Linear Search is acceptable when:

The dataset is small or frequently changes.

Simplicity is more important than performance.

Sorting the data is not feasible.


Conclusion:

For an e-commerce platform that needs efficient and scalable search functionality, Binary Search is recommended due to its O(log n) performance. Linear Search can still be used for small or temporary lists where sorting is not necessary.
